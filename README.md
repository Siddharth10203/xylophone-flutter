# XYLOPHONE FLUTTER
> Flutter Training Courses



One of the first few projects I undertook while progressing through the UDEMY course
[The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/). 
This course was my first direct exposure to mobile app development whereby I learnt 
how to develop apps with Flutter.
